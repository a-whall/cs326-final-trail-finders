# Important Components

The site will contain pages for each trail similar to a wiki which will contain pictures and general data such as location, maybe a trail map, and most importantly a list of user generated reviews. Users can add trail pages for those not already on the site. Within pages users can offer reviews which provide a star rating and a description. Other users can click to “agree” with a review giving a sense of accuracy to the review. Reviews can be ordered based on preference of the user by star rating, agree quantity, and other categories which we may think of later.

As well as the wiki, there will be a section of the site which acts as a forum for users to interact with each other. The forum can be separated into channels such as event promotion, trail questions, hiking gear discussion, etc. The format may evolve as the project progresses.

Types of Data include but are not limited to:
- Picture Collections for each trail
- Objects associated with each page
  - Location, elevation
  - Recreational feature flags (swimming, rock climbing, picnicking)
  - Overall rating
  - Accessibility
- User reviews
- Agrees (likes on reviews)
- Forum posts and replies
  - Hike events/meetups channel
- Profiles associated with users
  - User ratings
  - Basic user details(to be decided)
