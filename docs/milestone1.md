# Trail Page
The primary reason to visit this page will be to see images of specific trails and a scrollable list of reviews. It will feature links to other parts of the website such as the homepage, event pages and user profiles.

Here is the wireframe:

# Trail Page Creation Page

  ![missing-screenshot.PNG](../assets/project-screenshots/trailpage/create.PNG?raw=true)

This is an early prototype for the trail wiki page creation feature. The forms below "Features:" and "Activities:" will likely change. For example a checkbox list may work better than a text area if we can get an icon system for common features and activities.
